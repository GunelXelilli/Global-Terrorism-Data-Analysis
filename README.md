# Global Terrorism Data Analysis (GTD)

This project explores the **Global Terrorism Database (GTD)** using Python in Google Colab. The goal is to analyze patterns and trends in global terrorism incidents and visualize insights effectively.

## Overview

The GTD dataset contains detailed information on terrorist attacks worldwide. In this project, I:

- Cleaned and prepared the dataset for analysis  
- Performed exploratory data analysis (EDA)  
- Visualized trends over time, countries, and attack types  
- Highlighted key insights through clear charts

## Sample Visualizations
