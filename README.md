🌍 Global Terrorism Data Analysis (GTD)

A comprehensive exploration of the Global Terrorism Database (GTD) using Python and Google Colab. This project focuses on analyzing patterns, trends, and insights from global terrorism incidents.

🔍 Overview

The Global Terrorism Database contains detailed information on terrorist attacks worldwide. In this project, I performed:

Data Cleaning & Processing – Handling missing values, formatting columns, and preparing the dataset for analysis

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) – Identifying trends over time, countries, and attack types

Visualizations – Using Matplotlib and Seaborn to create clear, impactful charts

Insights – Highlighting key patterns that can help understand global terrorism dynamics

📊 Sample Visualizations


Figure 1: Number of attacks by country


Figure 2: Attack types across regions (heatmap)
